# CSS Background Image Not Found Bug

This repository demonstrates a common yet often overlooked CSS bug: referencing a background image that does not exist.  The bug is reproduced in `bug.css` and a solution is provided in `solution.css`.

## Bug Description
The `bug.css` file attempts to set the background image of an element to `missing-image.jpg`, which is not present. This leads to the background image not being displayed, and potentially unexpected visual results.

## Solution
The `solution.css` file corrects this issue.  It either uses a valid image path or provides a fallback solution.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Create a simple HTML file that includes an element with the class `my-element`.
3. Link to `bug.css` in your HTML file.
4. Observe that the element does not have the background image applied.
5. Replace `bug.css` with `solution.css` and observe the correct styling.
